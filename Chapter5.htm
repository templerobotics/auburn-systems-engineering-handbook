			The moon is a challenging place for human survival and equipment.&nbsp;&nbsp;There 
			is no free water (except for the possibility of water-ice at the 
			lunar poles), essentially no atmosphere and pressures of a hard 
			vacuum (&lt;10<sup>-6</sup>&nbsp;mm Hg).&nbsp;&nbsp;There 
			are severe temperature fluctuations, lethal radiation and a fine 
			lunar dust that is a concern for lunar base activities.&nbsp;&nbsp;The 
			terrain of the moon consists of common earth features including 
			craters, mountains, ridges, and plains.&nbsp;&nbsp;Volcanic 
			activity has long since ceased.&nbsp;&nbsp;Micrometeoroid 
			activity is very prevalent.&nbsp;&nbsp;There is some seismic activity due to 
			moonquakes (the largest ever recorded was an earth equivalent 
			magnitude of 4).&nbsp;&nbsp;The designer of any environmentally-exposed 
			component, structure or&nbsp;system must be aware of&nbsp;all the 
			environmental stressors, and account for their effects by 
			translating the environmental conditions to requirements in the 
			systems engineering process.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
			<p>
			Yet despite being so inhospitable, the environment does provide many 
			of the <em>in-situ</em> resources to build and sustain a lunar base.&nbsp;&nbsp;The 
			most important resources are sunlight and the lunar dirt called<i> regolith</i>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 
			sunlight is a source for thermal power and conversion to electrical 
			power.&nbsp;&nbsp;The 
			regolith can be processed to extract 1) oxygen for breathing, water 
			production and fuel, 2) hydrogen for fuel and water production and 
			3) metals for construction.&nbsp;&nbsp;Regolith 
			can also be used as a building material for roads, berms, habitats, 
			garages, landing pads, etc.&nbsp;</p>
			<p>
			The Lunar Sourcebook&nbsp;(Heiken, 
			Vaniman, &amp; French, 1991)&nbsp;is the source of&nbsp; most of the 
			information presented below.&nbsp;&nbsp;Other 
			useful references are the Lunar and Planetary Institute&nbsp;&nbsp;(LPI, 
			2008), which has Apollo Mission summaries, information on lunar 
			samples and Apollo documents describing the Apollo mission 
			equipment, including Lunar Roving Vehicles (LRVs) and landing 
			modules.&nbsp;There are many photographs, maps, reports and 
			information about lunar samples.&nbsp;&nbsp;The 
			Moon&nbsp;(Schrunk, 2008)&nbsp;and 
			The Lunar Base Handbook&nbsp;(Eckart, 
			1999)&nbsp;contain chapters 
			on these and other lunar topics.</p>
			<h2>
			<a name="GravityandLunarVacuum">Gravity, the Lunar Vacuum and 
			Pressure</a> </h2>
			<p>
			Gravitational acceleration on the moon’s surface is 1.622 m/sec<sup>2</sup>, 
			or about 1/6 that of earth. 
			Weights of everything will be 1/6 that of the same object on earth, 
			hence loaded structural members and mechanisms for supporting or 
			lifting loads can be made smaller and lighter.&nbsp;&nbsp;Lighter weights mean 
			that vehicles will have less available maximum tractive force than on earth for 
			the same mass vehicle.&nbsp; Of 
			course inertia forces (that is forces due to linear and rotational 
			accelerations) will still be present.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
			<p>
			Light gases, like hydrogen, are heated to velocities sufficiently 
			high enough to escape the gravitational pull.&nbsp; Most gases are 
			eventually removed by the solar wind.&nbsp;&nbsp; As 
			a result there is essentially no atmosphere to create an atmospheric pressure on 
			the surface, as we experience on earth from pressure created by the 
			weight of the column of air above us.&nbsp;&nbsp;The 
			atmospheric pressure on the surface of the moon was measured at ~1x 
			10<sup>-12</sup>&nbsp;mm Hg 
			(760 mm Hg = 1 atm= 1.01E5 Pa = 101 kPa), which is so little pressure that the 
			moon can be considered a hard vacuum.&nbsp;&nbsp;This 
			is a pressure that can only be achieved on earth in special vacuum 
			chambers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
			<p>
			Without 
			an atmosphere micrometeoroids are able to reach the surface at high speeds.&nbsp;&nbsp;Without 
			an atmosphere the sun’s radiation is more intense than on earth, and 
			particularly harmful types of radiation reach the surface.&nbsp;Organic 
			materials can&nbsp;<i>outgas</i> and release volatile chemicals when 
			exposed to low pressure.&nbsp;&nbsp;These 
			volatiles often become unwanted thin film deposits on nearby 
			surfaces.&nbsp;&nbsp; Despite the vacuum atmosphere there is 
			significant concern about atmospheric pollution created by lunar 
			missions and a lunar base.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Emitted gases can accumulate and 
			pollute what atmosphere is there, which could degrade the 
			performance of scientific instruments or manufacturing processes 
			that require a vacuum. </p>
			<p>
			Humans require a pressurized environment for survival functions such 
			as proper breathing and coughing.&nbsp; Living quarters will 
			effectively be pressure vessels that may be pressurized up to 1 
			atmosphere, but at least .26 to .3 atmospheres.&nbsp;&nbsp; Space 
			suits may have pressures less than one atmosphere to improve their 
			mobility (Jablonski &amp; Ogden, 2008).&nbsp; </p>
			<p>
			The thin atmosphere offers little thermal insulation, so 
			temperatures can drop quickly at night, and rise quickly due to the 
			sun&#39;s radiation during the day.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Powerful radiation 
			from sunlight on one side of an object, and shadow on the other will 
			create a large temperature gradient.&nbsp; A&nbsp; &quot;thermal shock&quot; 
			can follow, where different parts of an object thermally expand by 
			different amounts, leading to large potentially failure-inducing 
			strains.&nbsp; The effect of thermal shock is more pronounced in 
			brittle materials such as glass, ceramics or metals below the glass 
			transition temperature (ductile-brittle transition temperature for 
			metals).&nbsp; </p>
			<p>
			We are all familiar with convective 
			heat transfer used to cool or heat earth-based mechanical and 
			electrical components with blowing air.&nbsp; This method is not 
			available for controlling large temperature swings in 
			environmentally-exposed equipment because of the lack of an 
			atmosphere.&nbsp; Systems requiring thermal control must rely on 
			innovative thermal control techniques.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
			<h2>
			<a name="LunarDayandNight">The 
			Lunar Day and Night</a></h2>
			<p>
			Except near the poles the lunar day is 29.5 (earth) days long, with 
			the night lasting about 14-15 days and daylight (from sunrise to 
			sunset) also about the same.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Apollo missions operated 
			on the lunar surface only during daylight.&nbsp; A lunar year is the 
			same amount of time as an earth year.&nbsp;&nbsp;Very close to the poles, lunar daylight increases beyond 14-15 days.&nbsp;&nbsp;At 
			the poles the sun’s elevation varies between +/- 1°32’ above and 
			below the horizon, and night and day each last ½ earth year. For ½ 
			the year at the poles the sun is barely above the horizon.&nbsp;&nbsp;For 
			the other half the sun is barely below the horizon.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
			<p>
			Figure 
			1 shows the orbit of the moon around the earth.&nbsp;&nbsp;The 
			arrow on the moon is fixed to the moon, demonstrating that the moon 
			always shows the same side to the earth; hence the moon’s rotation 
			is said to be “gravitational-locked” to the earth. The opposite side 
			of the moon (aka the “darkside”) is not always dark and does see 
			sunlight, but is never visible from the earth.&nbsp;</p>

			<a name="Radiatation">Radiation</a></h2>
			<p>
			Radiation encompasses more than&nbsp;<i>electromagnetic 
			wave radiation, </i>which is classified and characterized by a wave and its frequency, and 
			includes visible light.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A 
			second form of radiation is&nbsp;<i>energized 
			particulate radiation</i>.&nbsp;&nbsp;The 
			more energetic radiation of both forms will not just affect the 
			surface of a material, but can also affect material 
			below the surface.&nbsp;&nbsp;Strong 
			radiation can also ionize material in its path and degrade material 
			properties; this is called&nbsp;<i>ionizing 
			radiation</i>.&nbsp;&nbsp;The 
			materials and equipment that are used on the moon must be able to 
			survive in the radiation environment or else be protected in order 
			to complete the mission.&nbsp;&nbsp;Special 
			environmental effects chambers are available at NASA that can be 
			used to expose materials to expected lunar dosages for testing.</p>
			<h3>
			<a name="EMParticleRad">Electromagnetic 
			and Particle Radiation&nbsp;</a>(Smithers, 
			2007; Tribble, 2003)</h3>
			<p>
			&nbsp;The electromagnetic wave spectrum of <em>electromagnetic 
			radiation</em> includes - in order 
			of increasing frequency - radio, microwave, terahertz, infrared, 
			visible light, ultra-violet, x-ray and gamma rays.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most 
			of this radiant energy comes from the sun and creates radiation heat 
			when striking an object. This radiation is the source of solar 
			power.&nbsp;&nbsp;It 
			strikes the moon with an average energy density of 1360 W/m<sup>2</sup>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some 
			of this radiation can be damaging, such as ultra-violet (UV)&nbsp;light, which 
			will chemically degrades&nbsp;polymer-based 
			material like plastics and composites.&nbsp;&nbsp;UV,&nbsp;X-rays and gamma rays 
			are strong electromagnetic <em>ionizing radiation</em>, and they possess enough kinetic energy to strip electrons off atoms.&nbsp;&nbsp;Shading 
			can be an effective strategy to protect some susceptible materials from 
			weaker radiation, but high energy radiation&nbsp;may&nbsp;go 
			through thin shades.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Metals 
			are not degraded chemically, but direct sunlight will create 
			significant increases in temperature causing thermal 
			expansion.&nbsp;</p>
			<p>
			The other form of radiation is <em>particle radiation</em>, made up 
			of 
			electrons, protons, neutrons, helium nuclei and heavy ions.&nbsp;&nbsp;High 
			energy charged particle radiation can also be ionizing.</p>
			<h3>
			<a name="IonizingRad">Ionizing Radiation</a></h3>
			<p>
			Charged particle energy is measured in electron volts (eV) per 
			particles, and the higher the energy the more potentially damaging 
			the particle is to anything exposed, including humans.&nbsp;&nbsp;The 
			major components of particle ionizing radiation on the moon are from&nbsp;<i>solar 
			winds</i>,&nbsp;<i>solar 
			cosmic rays from solar particle events</i>&nbsp;(SPE), 
			and&nbsp;<i>galactic cosmic 
			rays</i>&nbsp;(GCR).&nbsp;&nbsp;Each 
			type has a characteristic energy level measured in electron 
			volts (eV).&nbsp;&nbsp;The 
			higher the eV a particle has, the greater the damage, and similarly 
			the thicker the shielding required (although the most effective 
			shielding depends on the kind of radiation).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lack of an atmosphere on the moon allows ionizing radiation to 
			strike anything on the lunar surface.&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence 
			protection is often required, unlike on earth where our atmosphere 
			serves that function.&nbsp;&nbsp;In 
			addition to ionizing particles, the ionizing solar electromagnetic 
			radiation consists predominantly of vacuum UV.&nbsp;</p>
			<p>
			<i>Solar Wind</i></p>
			<p>
			Solar Wind is a steady stream of nuclear particles continuously 
			emitted by the sun.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It 
			is considered to be a <em>plasma</em>, which is a mixture of electrons and 
			positively-charged atoms (ions) from which the electrons have 
			been stripped.&nbsp;&nbsp;The 
			winds are composed mostly of low to mid-range energy protons (10 keV/nucleon), along with helium ions and electrons.&nbsp;&nbsp;Solar 
			wind travels at 300-700 km/s.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 
			wind itself is electrically neutral.&nbsp;&nbsp;It 
			is not considered to be particularly damaging because of its low 
			energy.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Solar 
			winds have steadily bombarded the surface of the moon for billions 
			of years, implanting valuable and easily recoverable volatile 
			elements into the regolith.&nbsp;&nbsp;Plasma 
			can charge a spacecraft to high electric potentials, leading to 
			possible arching.&nbsp;&nbsp;Methods 
			have been developed to ground the spacecraft to prevent charge 
			buildup&nbsp;(Tribble, 2003).</p>
			<p>
			<i>&nbsp;Solar Cosmic Rays from Solar Particle Events (SPE)</i></p>
			<p>
			SPE are from <em>solar flares</em>, which are violent explosions on the sun, 
			lasting only minutes and whose frequency peaks on an 11 year cycle.&nbsp;&nbsp;They 
			consist of a burst of electrons and protons with high energies 
			(&gt;10MeV) that can arrive in as little as 20 minutes after a solar 
			flare.&nbsp;&nbsp;A 
			large flux can arrive in a short period of time, and is lethal to 
			humans and damaging to exposed electronic equipment.&nbsp; Humans 
			and sensitive electronic equipment need to be moved to a 
			radiation-shielded protective safe area such as a regolith-covered 
			shelter.&nbsp; A warning system would be installed, since 
			solar flares can be seen by sun monitoring telescopes before the 
			radiation reaches the moon.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Associated 
			radio bursts may interrupt communications.</p>
			<p>
			<i>Galactic Cosmic Rays (GCR)</i></p>
			<p>
			GCR are very high energy ions (GeV/nucleon), and including heavier 
			nuclei equal to or smaller than 26 (iron).&nbsp;&nbsp;GCR 
			come from outside the solar system and are considered to be remnants 
			of the Big Bang.&nbsp;&nbsp;Their flux is low and constant.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;GCR 
			and SPE can burrow into material, and their tracks can be seen under 
			the microscope in regolith particle.&nbsp;</p>

			<a name="RadiationandSurvivability">Radiation 
			and Survivability</a></h3>
			<p>
			For 
			the astronaut and other biological systems, a simple space suit is 
			not adequate in the event of a life-threatening SPE.&nbsp;&nbsp;Solar 
			cells, made of photovoltaic semiconductors, are directly exposed and 
			are degraded by time exposure to both ionizing and electromagnetic 
			radiation.&nbsp;&nbsp;SPE 
			damage on solar panels can be reduced by preemptively shielding.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Exposed 
			organic material will be degraded by Ultra-Violet light, but could 
			be coated with a UV blocker like a sunscreen or other coating.&nbsp;&nbsp;Integrated 
			circuits and electronics can also be damaged by ionizing 
			radiation, but this may be circumvented 
			by rerouting electrical flow paths 
			around the damaged circuit elements.&nbsp;&nbsp;SPE 
			can be so strong that a metal protective housing may have to be 
			unrealizably thick to be completely effective.&nbsp;&nbsp;In 
			the case of SPE events the humans and equipment are effectively 
			shielded by at least 2m -5m of regolith.&nbsp;&nbsp;The 
			most effective materials for shielding SPE particles contain 
			hydrogen, such as polyethylene and water.&nbsp;&nbsp;Design 
			of shielding for equipment should involve a trade study, comparing 
			all the alternative shielding methods, their cost and the risks 
			involved.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SPE 
			can be a concern when sensitive electronics and equipment far from a 
			regolith shelter become trapped in an SPE.&nbsp;</p>

			Specific materials radiation resistance is shown in Table 1.&nbsp;&nbsp;Biologic 
			matter and electronics are most severely affected and so require the 
			most protection.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Radiation 
			can strongly affect and degrade the performance of semiconductors 
			components, such as transistors and diodes.&nbsp;&nbsp;Solar 
			cells are diodes that convert light energy to electrical, each cell 
			producing potential difference of 1 volt and a few mA of current.&nbsp;&nbsp;Both 
			current and voltage, and hence power output, are reduced with 
			radiation dose.&nbsp;&nbsp;Designers 
			must take into account that solar cell efficiency will decrease as 
			the dosage increases, by oversizing the solar cells so that they 
			will provide the needed power for a chosen lifetime.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Transparent 
			coverslides have been used for solar cells to absorb and protect 
			against radiation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indium 
			arsenide solar cells are more resistant than gallium arsenide solar 
			cells, which are more resistant that silicon solar cells.</p>
			<p>
			In electrical components ionizing radiation can cause tiny current 
			spikes because the process of ionization can bump an electron 
			from a lower valence to a conducting electron.&nbsp;&nbsp;As 
			electronics components, such as microprocessors and 
			microcontrollers, have gotten smaller the effect of ionizing 
			radiation and the susceptibility of those devices from a single 
			particle has been more pronounced.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If 
			radiation causes a memory device to flip a bit, it is called a&nbsp;<i>single 
			event upset&nbsp;</i>(SEU).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Power 
			MOSFET transistors can burnout.&nbsp;&nbsp;Given 
			the expected environmental dosage of radiation, there are software 
			routines that can calculate dose versus depth of shielding for each 
			type of radiation&nbsp;(Conley, 
			1998),&nbsp;(Tribble, 2003).&nbsp;&nbsp;Electronics 
			can be “radiation-hardened” by selecting more expensive 
			semiconductors that are designed to be resistant to single events 
			caused by radiation, and through circuit design.&nbsp;&nbsp;Sensitive 
			material can also be protected with an additional layer of 
			shielding.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
			<p>
			Many materials and electronic components have been tested in space 
			environmental chambers, and data is available for the designer.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If 
			a non-electronic test sample is put in chamber and exposed, a 
			follow-up tensile test is often a good measure of strength loss.&nbsp;&nbsp;Figure 
			2 shows the radiation resistance of the range of materials based on 
			dose.&nbsp;&nbsp;Polymers 
			are the most degraded, and metals the least.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Plastics 
			polymerize, capacitors can discharge, steel can embrittle, etc.&nbsp;&nbsp;Basic 
			metals exposed to SPE can darken, which affects the thermal 
			properties.&nbsp;</p>
			<p>
			Charged particle radiation testing of materials can be performed on 
			a Pelletron accelerator that can produce a beam of 250 keV 
			electrons, and a positive ion accelerator.&nbsp;&nbsp;Gamma 
			radiation testing can be performed with a radioactive Cobalt-60 
			source placed nearby to radiate the test material.&nbsp;&nbsp;Vacuum 
			UV testing requires a deuterium arc lamp.</p>

			<a name="SurfaceTemperature">Surface 
			Temperature</a></h2>
			<p>
			The sun is the primary source that heats the moon.&nbsp; Surface temperatures 
			will vary with lunar latitude, longitude and time of day.&nbsp;&nbsp;The 
			temperature also changes with depth below the surface.&nbsp;&nbsp;The 
			lunar surface heats up and cools much faster than earth&#39;s 
			surface.&nbsp;&nbsp;Significant temperature differences can exist across a boundary 
			between shadow and sunlight.</p>
			<p>
			The moon absorbs most of the light that falls on it, causing the 
			regolith temperature to rise substantially during the day.&nbsp;&nbsp;The 
			moon’s average&nbsp;<i>albedo</i>&nbsp;(the 
			fraction of visible electromagnetic radiation reflected by the 
			surface of a material) is only 0.07 - .10, which makes it as 
			absorptive as black paint&nbsp;(Heiken 
			et al., 1991). Thus the sunlit regions of the lunar surface have 
			very high surface temperatures.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
			<p>
			&nbsp;Table 2 shows day and night temperature extremes of&nbsp; 
			various lunar locations.&nbsp; Just as on earth, the sun produces 
			the highest daytime highs near the 
			equator, where the regolith surface temperature can reach over 250°F.&nbsp;&nbsp;Lunar surface temperatures increase 280°K near 
			the equator from the low just before dawn to the high at noon&nbsp;(Heiken 
			et al., 1991).&nbsp; Progressing down the table from the &quot;Equator&quot; 
			row, we see that as the latitude progresses from the equator to the 
			poles,&nbsp; the daytime high decreases while the nighttime low 
			increases.&nbsp;
			At the poles the sun rises a maximum of 1.6 degrees above the 
			horizon, causing daytime temperatures there to be much less than at 
			the equator.&nbsp;Because 
			craters can be deep and have steep walls, it is possible that the 
			regolith in dark polar craters never sees sunlight and is always in the 
			shadows.&nbsp;&nbsp;This 
			leads to a nearly constant and extremely low temperature of about 40 
			degrees Kelvin.&nbsp;&nbsp;Sensor 
			data from the Lunar Prospector orbit of the moon in 1998 indicated 
			the presence of hydrogen inside dark polar craters (which may take 
			the form of hydrogen or water ice).&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

			<p>
			The temperature of an object just above the surface of the 
			moon where near vacuum conditions exist is an interesting question.&nbsp;&nbsp;Temperature 
			is a measure of the vibrational energy of the molecules of an 
			object. Therefore the vacuum of space, unlike the air that 
			surrounds us, cannot have a temperature.&nbsp;&nbsp;In 
			an isolated vacuum chamber - with the walls at a particular 
			temperature being the only radiation source - an ideal thermometer 
			(which itself is an object made up of matter) will display the 
			temperature of the surrounding walls.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now 
			consider the vacuum &quot;chamber&quot; of space; space is filled with 
			radiation energy that raises an object’s temperature like the walls 
			of the isolated vacuum chamber.&nbsp;&nbsp;In 
			our solar system that radiation energy is mostly particles and waves 
			from the sun, although the moon and the earth also radiate energy.&nbsp;&nbsp;When 
			the sun is blocked such as at night, then the moon and earth 
			radiation are the most significant sources of radiation energy.&nbsp;&nbsp;Anywhere 
			in space, any object will assume an equilibrium temperature where 
			the power it radiates (which is proportional to T<sup>4</sup>&nbsp;of 
			the object and is thermal infra-red) balances with absorbed power 
			that was radiated by nearby celestial bodies and other objects (see 
			the Thermal Control chapter for temperature of the moon, earth and sun).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If 
			the body is attached to the lunar surface, conduction of heat from 
			the lunar surface must also be included.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For 
			a detailed description of the lunar thermal environment and 
			calculation methodologies, refer to the chapter on Thermal Control.</p>
			<p>
			Equipment designers should be concerned with an extreme temperature 
			gradient that occurs when one part of a device is exposed to the sun 
			and the other in shade (Imagine a vehicle exposed to the light of 
			the setting sun).&nbsp;&nbsp;The 
			large heat flux can create a significant thermal control problem.&nbsp;&nbsp;Radiation 
			is dependent upon the surface properties of absorptance and 
			emittance.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All 
			heat absorbed by an object on the moon is conducted to cooler parts 
			of the object and its supports, and also radiated back to space.&nbsp;&nbsp;Large 
			thermal gradients caused by one side of an object in sunlight and 
			another side in the shade can cause high thermal stresses, strains 
			and distortions in devices with redundant load paths.&nbsp;&nbsp;Satellites 
			can roll like a rotisserie, but lunar equipment may not be able to 
			roll.&nbsp;&nbsp;Thermal 
			fatigue can occurs from many high temperature/low temperature strain 
			cycles.&nbsp;&nbsp;Consider 
			mating parts made with materials with low or similar coefficients of 
			thermal expansion.&nbsp;&nbsp;Thermal 
			swings can damage electronics.&nbsp;&nbsp;Outgasing 
			of materials and lubricant is also increased with temperature, so 
			design so lubricants do not evaporate and polymer seals are 
			thermally protected.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Low 
			temperatures can cause certain materials to become brittle and loose 
			ductility.&nbsp;&nbsp;Be 
			aware of component and material operating temperature range (e.g. 
			the ductile-brittle transition temperature for metals and the glass 
			transition temperature for composites) and 
			design to operate in that range.</p>

			<a name="Micrometeoroids">Micrometeoroids</a></h2>
			<p>
			Micrometeoroids are meteoroids (naturally occurring solid bodies 
			traveling through space) that are less than 1mm diameter, and based 
			on their average density their mass will be less than .01 g.&nbsp;Probability 
			of impact and risk is difficult to assess, but a 1 milligram 
			micrometeoroid could hit larger facilities and equipment.&nbsp;&nbsp;Even 
			though small, the high impact speed of 13-18 km/sec can make 
			micrometeoroid impact damage a concern, so it must be a design 
			consideration.&nbsp;&nbsp;The 
			damage may&nbsp;not 
			be just small pitting.&nbsp;&nbsp;Penetration 
			thickness and crater depth of an impact can be estimated using 
			empirical formula for certain materials presented in&nbsp;(Elfer, 
			1996)&nbsp;as a function of&nbsp;impacted 
			material density, thickness, impact particle mass and speed.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It 
			can also be tested with hypervelocity impact guns at test 
			facilities.&nbsp;&nbsp;If 
			occurring at low temperature brittle fracture may occur for some 
			materials.&nbsp;&nbsp;Thin 
			metallic sheets might perforate.&nbsp;&nbsp;However 
			just a few millimeters of a tough composite material is estimated to 
			provide sufficient protection from these micrometeoroid impact in 
			the 1 milligram range&nbsp;(Heiken 
			et al., 1991).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although 
			larger impacts caused by larger micrometeoroids do occur, they are 
			infrequent.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lunar habitats and garages will have to be designed to protect 
			against even the larger micrometeoroids.&nbsp;</p>

			Neil Armstrong, as he stepped onto the moon, stated</p>
			<p>
			<i>“the surface is fine and powdery.&nbsp;&nbsp;I 
			can pick it up loosely with my toes.&nbsp;&nbsp;It 
			does adhere in fine layers like powdered charcoal to the sole and 
			sides of my boots.&nbsp;&nbsp;I 
			only go in a small fraction of an inch.&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe 
			an eighth of an inch, but I can see the footprints on my boots and 
			the treads in the sandy particles”</i></p>
			<p>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 
			moon’s surface is almost entirely covered in a thin layer with lunar 
			dirt and dust and rock fragments, together called lunar regolith.&nbsp;&nbsp;During 
			the Apollo missions, fine particles of this dust were found coated 
			on equipment surfaces and infiltrating joints of mechanisms.&nbsp;</p>
			<p>
			Astronaut Alan Bean stated</p>
			<p>
			<i>“After lunar liftoff . . . a great quantity of dust floated free 
			within the cabin. This dust made breathing without the helmet 
			difficult, and enough particles were present in the cabin atmosphere 
			to affect our vision. The use of a whisk broom prior to ingress 
			would probably not be satisfactory in solving the dust problem, 
			because the dust tends to rub deeper into the garment rather than to 
			brush off”</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;(Bean 
			et al..,&nbsp;1970).</p>
			<p>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apparently 
			lunar dust was brought into the lunar excursion module with items 
			that had been exposed to the regolith when they passed through the 
			airlock.&nbsp;&nbsp;The dust coated 
			internal surfaces and floated in the cabin atmosphere.&nbsp;&nbsp;It 
			adhered to space suits, hand tools, optical equipment and mechanical 
			equipment with moving parts. The dust impaired the proper operation 
			of seals and lubricants used on various mechanisms.&nbsp;&nbsp;Exposed 
			optical equipment, such as camera lenses and mirrors, was adversely 
			affected by its accumulation on optical surfaces.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It 
			is anticipated that solar cells that rely on the photoelectric 
			effect will be less efficient once coated with regolith. 
			Characteristics of the lunar dust that led to these adverse effects 
			- such as electrostatic charge and small and angular particles, and 
			others – are discussed below.</p>
			<p>
			<i>Lunar regolith</i>&nbsp;refers 
			to all the fragmented rock material that covers the moon.&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Lunar 
			soil</i>&nbsp;is technically 
			regolith excluding rocks larger than 1 cm in size.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Lunar 
			dust</i>&nbsp;is technically 
			defined as having particle sizes less the 20 μm with a bulk density 
			of 1.5 g/cm<sup>3</sup>.</p>
			<p>
			The thickness of regolith layer depends on the region and the 
			geologic features.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It 
			is estimated to be&nbsp;<span lang="EN">4-5 
			meters thick in mare regions (lunar planes) and 10-15 m in older 
			highland regions (plains of higher elevation than the mare).&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>On 
			steep crater wall there may be little or no regolith.&nbsp;&nbsp;Regolith 
			has two zones.&nbsp;&nbsp;The 
			first few centimeters to tens of centimeters is well mixed or 
			“gardened” zone, from the churning of repeated micrometeoroid 
			strikes.&nbsp;</p>
			<p>
			The material is strikingly different than earth soil in appearance 
			and method of formation.&nbsp;&nbsp;Examination under a microscope revealed it 
			to be made up of a significant amount of very sharp and angular 
			particles.&nbsp; <span lang="EN">Lunar soils are far more abrasive 
			than earth soils.&nbsp;</span> Earth soils are 
			created by the forces of wind and water, eventually breaking large 
			rocks into small particles, and also causing a mechanical rounding 
			of the particles.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without 
			water and wind other mechanisms had to be at play to create lunar 
			soil.&nbsp;&nbsp;Geologist 
			now believe that the lunar soil was&nbsp;<span lang="EN">formed over 
			time by the impact of large and small meteoroids and the steady 
			bombardment of high speed micrometeoroid.&nbsp;This continually broke 
			rock fragments to smaller particle sizes, 
			although lunar soil may have lots of variation of particle sizes.&nbsp;&nbsp;Older 
			soils usually have more of the finer (smaller) particles because they have 
			been subjected to more impacts.&nbsp;&nbsp;Billions 
			of years of the impacts churned and mixed the soil.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
			<p>
			Microscopic inspection of regolith reveals that it is made up of a 
			combination of mineral fragments (<i>minerals</i>&nbsp;possess 
			a&nbsp;<span lang="EN">characteristic 
			chemical composition, a highly ordered atomic structure and specific 
			physical properties</span>),&nbsp;<i>glasses</i>&nbsp;(visible 
			without distinct grains and without a highly ordered atomic 
			structure, that are often sharp and abrasive like broken glass and 
			lead to the abrasiveness),&nbsp;<i>lithic 
			fragments</i>(pieces of broken lunar rock which also contains 
			minerals) and&nbsp;<i>agglutinates&nbsp;</i>(which 
			are small (&lt;1 mm) lunar regolith particles bonded together with 
			glass, Figure 3).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 
			minerals are usually silicates and oxides, which both contain a 
			significant amount of oxygen.&nbsp;&nbsp;To 
			extract that oxygen may require high temperature processes and 
			associated high energy input.</p>
			<p>
			Lunar regolith can have a high percentage of agglutinates.&nbsp;&nbsp;Agglutinates 
			were formed by the melting and mixing that occurred when a 
			micrometeoroid(s) struck regolith at very high speed, with impacted 
			regolith and micrometeoroid partially melting and refreezing together.&nbsp;&nbsp;Interestingly, 
			these are very abundant (up to 60% of lunar soil), which must imply 
			a lot of micrometeoroid impacts have happened on the moon.&nbsp;&nbsp;They 
			also contain a significant amount of pure iron droplets.&nbsp;&nbsp;Agglutinates 
			are a significant contributor to soil strength and soil 
			characteristics when digging, creating berms, building structures, 
			etc.&nbsp;&nbsp;The presence of free and magnetic iron has&nbsp;led 
			some to propose&nbsp;&quot;magnetic 
			vacuuming&quot; as an excavation technique, and also &quot;microwave sintering&quot; 
			for&nbsp;consolidating 
			regolith&nbsp;for roads 
			and landing pads.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
			<p>
			Regolith also contains a significant amount of implanted&nbsp;<i>solar-wind 
			elements</i>, including hydrogen and carbon.&nbsp;&nbsp;These 
			are considered to be easily extracted by mild heating of regolith.</p>

			<h3>
			<a name="OtherPhysicalProperties">Other Physical Properties of 
			Regolith</a></h3>
			<h4>
			Electrostatically Charged</h4>
			<p>
			Lunar dust carries an electrostatic charge, implanted by the solar 
			winds, that allows it to stick to anything that is not grounded.&nbsp;&nbsp;The 
			smaller particles adhere to space-suits, tools, equipment, polished 
			reflectors, solar cells and telescope lenses.&nbsp;&nbsp;Easily 
			disturbed by landing and launch vehicles the small particles are 
			thrown great distances so methods are required to limit the spread.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 
			lunar dust will erode bearings, gears, and other mechanical 
			mechanisms not properly sealed.&nbsp;&nbsp;It 
			will be difficult to disconnect and reconnect electrical, fluid and 
			mechanical connections without dust contamination.&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, 
			because the lunar dust is very dark, a thin layering on radiator 
			elements can significantly raise the normal solar absorption of 
			these elements.&nbsp;&nbsp;Because 
			it is abrasive it can damage sensitive equipment and/or affect 
			performance.&nbsp;It may stick with greater force to some 
			materials than others.&nbsp;&nbsp;Measures 
			must be taken to reduce the layering of lunar dust on equipment, 
			such as by covering when not in use, or using specialized equipment 
			designed for the purposes of dust removal.&nbsp;</p>
			<p>
			<strong>Free Radicals</strong></p>
			<p>
			There is some discussion that the regolith may contain free 
			radicals, which are atoms or molecules with unpaired electrons which 
			make them highly reactive.&nbsp;</p>
			<h4>
			Conductivity</h4>
			<p>
			Regolith has very low electrical and thermal conductivity, and low 
			dielectric loss.&nbsp;&nbsp;The 
			low electrical conductivity allows it to accumulate electrostatic 
			charge, and does so from the effects of UV radiation.&nbsp;&nbsp;The 
			DC conductivity ranges from 10<sup>-14</sup>&nbsp;mho/m 
			when sunlit to 10<sup>-9</sup>&nbsp;mho/m 
			in darkness.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For 
			this and other reasons radio transmissions should easily penetrate 
			10 m of lunar soil&nbsp;(Heiken 
			et al., 1991).</p>
			<p>
			The low thermal conductivity makes lunar soil an excellent thermal 
			insulator.&nbsp;&nbsp;Thermal 
			conductivity was measured to be 1.5x10<sup>-5</sup>&nbsp;W/cm<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;for 
			the top 1-2 cm.&nbsp;&nbsp;Conductivity 
			increases with bulk density; at 5-7 cm the conductivity increases 5 
			to 7 times from the surface. This low conductivity means that buried 
			habitats may need to be reject waste heat because of the thermal 
			resistance of the regolith walls.&nbsp;Thermometers used to 
			measure the temperature at 80 cm depth showed no temperature variation 
			from day to night, measuring a constant 250 and 252K at two 
			locations in the Apollo 15 landing area (Figure 4).&nbsp;&nbsp;Due 
			to the low thermal conductivity of the lunar surface, shadowed areas 
			of the surface can reach extremely low temperatures very quickly.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

			Lunar rocks (originating from broken bedrock) and regolith contain 
			minerals. &nbsp;Only 
			a limited number of minerals are found on the moon, and the more 
			common minerals on the moon are also found on the earth.&nbsp;&nbsp;Minerals 
			found on the moon include the silicates, which have silicon and 
			oxygen atoms in their molecule, along with other elements such as 
			Calcium, Iron, Sodium, Magnesium and Aluminum.&nbsp;&nbsp;Oxide 
			minerals all have oxygen in their molecule, along with elements such 
			as Chromium, Titanium, Aluminum, Iron and Magnesium.&nbsp;</p>
			<p>
			Regolith is chemically different from lunar rocks, and is 
			considered a more valuable resource.&nbsp;&nbsp;Chemical 
			composition of regolith from Apollo and Luna mission samples are 
			presented in Figure 5 (Note that the elements are by convention 
			presented by their oxide formulae).&nbsp;&nbsp;The 
			average mass percentage of major constituent elements in lunar 
			regolith in the lunar highlands is 45% oxygen, 21% silicon, 13% 
			aluminum, 10% calcium, 5.5% magnesium, 6% iron with less than 1% 
			titanium, sodium and sulfur.&nbsp;&nbsp;Many 
			chemical processes have been proposed to extract oxygen and other 
			elements from regolith, some of which require extremely high 
			temperatures to melt the regolith&nbsp;(Schrunk, 
			2008).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Applications 
			for these elements on a sustainable lunar base include:</p>
			<p>
			o&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oxygen 
			for air and water production, and as an oxidizer in rocket 
			propellant.</p>
			<p>
			o&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hydrogen 
			for fuel and water production</p>
			<p>
			o&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aluminum, 
			titanium and iron for structures and machinery, as a reflective or 
			coating metal, possibly as a rocket fuel.&nbsp;</p>
			<p>
			o&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aluminum 
			for electrical wire</p>
			<p>
			o&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Silicon 
			for fiber optic cable, solar cells, computer chips</p>
			<p>
			o&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sulfur 
			for lunar cement (to be mixed with regolith as aggregate to form 
			lunar cement)</p>

			Other volatile elements called&nbsp;<i>solar-wind-implanted 
			element</i>&nbsp;exist on the 
			regolith, but in lesser amounts.&nbsp;&nbsp;Other 
			than the dark craters, hydrogen only occurs as a 
			solar-wind-implanted element that penetrate and are embedded a short 
			depth (a few hundredths of a micrometer) into the surface of 
			particles of exposed regolith.&nbsp;&nbsp;The 
			most abundant element from the solar winds is hydrogen, followed by 
			helium. Carbon and nitrogen are also solar-wind-implanted elements, 
			along with noble gases helium, neon, argon, xenon and krypton. The 
			concentrations of H, C and N are believed to be quite low (less than 
			100 micrograms/gram) and only in the lunar soils. It is estimated 
			that excavating 10cm deep, .7 km<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;area 
			would produce 1 ton of H (based on 50&nbsp;mg/g 
			regolith)&nbsp;(Eckart, 1999).&nbsp;&nbsp;One 
			km square of regolith, 2m deep could produce 1.5 million liters of 
			water&nbsp;(Eckart, 1999).&nbsp;&nbsp;Solar-wind-implanted 
			elements are volatiles that can be removed by moderate heating (up 
			to 700 degrees C).&nbsp;&nbsp;The 
			dark craters at the poles do have significantly higher concentration 
			of hydrogen, possibly as water-ice.&nbsp;&nbsp;A 
			future mission will determine the nature of the hydrogen present in 
			dark lunar craters.</p>
			<p>
			<sup>3</sup>He (helium-3) is another trace element planted by solar 
			winds in extremely low concentrations, with potential use for 
			commercial fusion power.&nbsp;&nbsp;Many 
			other elements exist in trace amounts, see the Lunar Sourcebook if 
			interested.&nbsp;</p>

			<a name="GeotechnicalandEngineeringProperties">Geotechnical 
			and Engineering Properties</a></h3>
			<p>
			Geotechnical properties include information about the particle size 
			and distribution, bulk density and relative density.&nbsp;&nbsp;Engineering 
			(soil mechanics) properties include parameter values that can be 
			used to predict soil behavior and forces expected from the digging 
			tool in order to size the frame, bearings, motors, and mechanisms of 
			an excavator.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Engineering 
			properties include cohesion and internal friction angle, although&nbsp;the 
			mathematical models have been poor predictors of excavation forces&nbsp;(Willman 
			&amp; Boles, 1995).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

			Samples of regolith were collected by astronauts during the six 
			Apollo moon landing missions (Apollo 11, 12, 14, 15, 16 and 17) and 
			Luna 24.&nbsp;&nbsp;Over 
			300 kg of samples were collected, brought back to earth and studied.&nbsp;&nbsp;The 
			dirt was collected in a variety of ways, including coring (Figure 6 
			and 7) 
			to collect subsurface samples with a drill and drill-stem corer 
			(Figure 8).&nbsp;&nbsp;More 
			sample cores&nbsp;can 
			be viewed at<a href="http://www.lpi.usra.edu/lunar/samples/index.shtml#soils">http://www.lpi.usra.edu/lunar/samples/index.shtml#soils</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;At 
			the&nbsp;surface 
			regolith has a significant amount of extremely 
			fine particles&nbsp;of 
			lunar dust.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lunar 
			dust is so small that it cannot be seen with the human eye, and it 
			constitutes about 10-20%&nbsp;&nbsp;by 
			weight of the soil.&nbsp;&nbsp;The 
			mean regolith particle size is between 40-100&nbsp;mm.&nbsp;&nbsp;The 
			largest “particles” in the regolith are rocks up to .8m diameter.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How 
			did the regolith particles get so small?&nbsp;&nbsp;Repeated 
			micro-meteoroid impacts over a long period of time are believed to 
			have ground it down to this size.</p>

			The particle size increases with depth below the surface.&nbsp;&nbsp;These 
			particles are described as being sharp, jagged, and extremely 
			abrasive, like broken glass.&nbsp;&nbsp;Drilling 
			into the regolith the average particle size will increase, until the 
			drill eventually hit bedrock if one digs deep enough.&nbsp; </p>
			<p>
			The&nbsp;<i>bulk density</i>&nbsp;(weight 
			of soil per unit volume) at the surface is approximately 1.3 g/cm<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;(water 
			is 1 g/cm),&nbsp;&nbsp;increases 
			rapidly to 1.52 g/cm<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp;at 
			a depth of 10 cm, then more gradually to 1.83 g/cm<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp;at 
			a depth of 100 cm.&nbsp; Thereafter, the density asymptotically 
			approaches a value of 1.92 g/cm<sup>3</sup>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soil is not as 
			dense a solid rock because of the presence of voids between the 
			particles.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 
			density of a typical soil particle or lunar rock is about 3.1 g/cm<sup>3</sup>.&nbsp;</p>
			<p>
			<i>Relative density</i>&nbsp;<i>r<sub>R</sub></i><sub>&nbsp;</sub>is 
			a measure soil particle packing.&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Void 
			ratio</i>&nbsp;<i>e</i>&nbsp;is 
			the volume of void space between particles divided by the total 
			volume.&nbsp;&nbsp;Relative 
			density is a percentage scaling of the range from minimum to maximum 
			void ratio as defined by the equation:</p>
			<p>
			<sub>
			<img src="SiteImageFiles/Chapter5/image143.gif" /></sub></p>
			<p>
			Relative density increases rapidly for the first 5-10 cm to a very 
			high relative density. Relative densities of lunar soils vary from 
			65% near the surface to over 90% below 30 cm.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Relative 
			density of a given soil can be increased by low-amplitude vertical 
			shaking,&nbsp;&nbsp;causing 
			the soil particles to settle due to gravity to a more tightly packed 
			arrangement.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 
			soil will continue to increase in bulk density with time on the 
			shaker, until it reaches a limiting bulk density.&nbsp;&nbsp;At 
			100% relative density the particles have oriented and packed 
			preferentially into the tightest (most dense) packing possible, i.e. 
			it is &quot;well consolidated&quot;.&nbsp;&nbsp;Even 
			when densely packed, the regolith is still very porous, i.e. having 
			lots of void space between the particles, in fact it can be up to 
			50% void space.&nbsp;&nbsp;Lunar 
			soils are very densely packed when compared to earth soils; the 
			cause of this effect is again attributed to continuously 
			micrometeoroid bombardment that continuously churns the top soil, 
			while shaking and increasing the relative density of the soil below.&nbsp;&nbsp;The 
			relative density affects properties such as thermal conductivity, 
			seismic velocity, shear strength, compressibility and dielectric 
			constant.&nbsp;&nbsp;The 
			depth of penetration of LRV was related to the relative density, the 
			average depth being 1.25 cm.&nbsp;&nbsp;When 
			walking on the surface, astronaut Buzz Aldrin noted that the soil at 
			the surface was soft, but there was a much firmer stratum at a 
			shallow depth.&nbsp;</p>
			<p>
			Strength of lunar soils is may be explained by Mohr-Coulomb equation<a name="mohrcoulombeqn"></a>:</p>
			<p>
			<img border="0" src="SiteImageFiles/Chapter5/image144.gif" v:shapes="_x0000_i1026" /></p>
			<p>
			<span class="style9">τ</span>&nbsp;is 
			the shear strength (kPa), c is cohesion,&nbsp;<span class="style9">φ</span>&nbsp;is 
			the friction angle and&nbsp;<span class="style9">σ</span>&nbsp;is 
			the normal stress.&nbsp;&nbsp;Parameter 
			values for c and&nbsp;<span class="style9">φ</span> can be 
			determined by standard soil mechanics tests.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By soil mechanics 
			convention&nbsp;<span class="style9">σ positive</span> when in compression.&nbsp; 
			Shear strength increases with normal or confining stress, which 
			is expected since particles become more interlocked.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shear 
			failure can be imaged as one plane sliding on another when&nbsp;the 
			sliding forces exceed the&nbsp;limiting 
			values of static friction.&nbsp;Cohesion 
			c represents the soil shear strength when there is no confining 
			pressure, and lunar soils have large 
			cohesion compared to earth soils.&nbsp;&nbsp;Distinct 
			astronaut footprints are evidence of nonzero cohesion (Figure 9).</p>
			<p>
			&nbsp;If a Mohr’s circle representation of a stress state 
			(plotted in the&nbsp;<span class="style9">τ-</span>&nbsp;<span class="style9">σ
			</span>plane) 
			is below the line defined by the&nbsp;equation, 
			then the soil should not fail.&nbsp;&nbsp;The 
			Mohr-Coulomb equation is also used for brittle materials, and is 
			used to predict the failure of lunar&nbsp;soils&nbsp;under 
			simple load conditions.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Friction 
			angle and cohesion increase&nbsp;with 
			depth in lunar soils, and are shown in Figure 11.&nbsp;&nbsp;This 
			is not unexpected, given that lunar soils have better packing 
			(higher relative density) with greater depth.&nbsp;&nbsp;The 
			shear strength is needed in the analytical prediction of the 
			ultimate <em>bearing capacity</em>, <em>slope stability </em>and <em>trafficability</em> (the 
			capacity of a soil to provide sufficient traction for movement).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Excavation 
			forces can also be predicted based on Mohr-Coulomb Theory.</p>
			<p>
			<i>Bearing Capacity</i></p>
			<p>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 
			bearing capacity is the ability of a soil to support a load, such as 
			a structure or an astronaut, and depends on the load and the area of 
			the footing.&nbsp;&nbsp;Soil 
			settlement can also be estimated.&nbsp;&nbsp;According 
			to (Heiken et al., 1991), &nbsp;the 
			ultimate bearing capacity is very high and therefore the lunar 
			surface should be able to support any conceivable spacecraft or 
			structure, although a complete understanding of lunar soil strength 
			under higher stress conditions will be required.</p>
			<p>
			<i>Slope Stability</i></p>
			<p>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Slope 
			stability, as evidenced in the lunar missions, may be explainable by 
			shear strength, Mohr-Coulomb theory and parameter values (although 
			an improved equation is presented in&nbsp;(Heiken 
			et al., 1991)).&nbsp;The deeper a cut, the less the angle 
			can be of a stable slope (Figure 12).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According 
			to Figure 12, an excavated slope can be vertical to a depth of 3 m, 
			and in fact boreholes in the lunar surface remained with stable 
			walls after the bit was removed.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, 
			when constructing a berm or embankment, either by dumping or dumping 
			then compacting, the soil will not be as strong, so the maximum 
			slope will be less than an excavated slope.&nbsp;&nbsp;This 
			occurs because the undisturbed soil is already in a highly packed 
			(high density) state, but looses that and becomes more loosely 
			packed when disturbed.&nbsp;</p>
			<p>
			<i>Trafficability</i></p>
			<p>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Trafficability 
			is the capacity of a soil to provide sufficient traction.&nbsp;&nbsp;From 
			the Apollo mission and the LRV, wheeled vehicles were effective and 
			were able to generate needed traction.&nbsp;&nbsp;However 
			the LRV was not carrying a heavy load, such as regolith from an 
			excavation site.&nbsp;&nbsp;On 
			one instance the Apollo 15 LRV encountered soft soil and spun its 
			wheels, so soft soil could be a problem in a heavily loaded vehicle 
			or hauling a heavy load.&nbsp;&nbsp;Bekker 
			equations&nbsp;(Bekker, 1969)&nbsp;have 
			been used to determine the sinkage, rolling resistance and forward 
			thrust.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

			&nbsp;Much work has been done on mathematical and empirical 
			modeling of soil excavation.&nbsp;&nbsp;Blouin&nbsp;(Blouin, 
			2001)&nbsp;reviewed resistive 
			force models for earth moving machines and for excavators like 
			bucketwheels.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Willman 
			and Boles&nbsp;(Willman &amp; 
			Boles, 1995)&nbsp;compared 3-D 
			models to predict the force needed to fail lunar simulant with a 
			flat blade.&nbsp;&nbsp;Comparisons 
			of different model simulations and experimental tests have 
			discrepancies which are as yet unexplained.&nbsp;&nbsp;Blouin 
			stated that “there is yet no well-established validation procedure 
			for models of cutting and excavation”.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A 
			simple model proposed by Zheng&nbsp;(Zheng, 
			2007)&nbsp;follows from a free 
			body diagram analysis of the soil in Figure 13, including blade 
			force and shearing along a failure surface.&nbsp;&nbsp;Zheng’s 
			equations are easily programmed in Excel.&nbsp;&nbsp;See 
			the Appendix for an example calculation.&nbsp;</p>

			<a name="RegolithSimulants">Regolith Simulants</a></a></h3>
			<p>
			Only about 300 kilograms of lunar soil was brought to the earth for 
			analysis, so it is essentially unavailable to researchers for all 
			but the most critical testing needs.&nbsp;&nbsp;However 
			processes (resource extraction) and engineering equipment that will 
			be exposed to or use regolith on the moon must be tested and 
			validated.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence 
			there has been a significant effort to create simulants that mimic 
			some of the chemical, geotechnical, engineering and/or physical 
			properties.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Simulants 
			are needed to test excavators, rovers, airlocks, earthmoving 
			equipment, structures, dust removal techniques, space suits, etc.; 
			these simulants should approach or match the geotechnical 
			properties, such as the abrasive nature and particle size 
			distribution of regolith.&nbsp;&nbsp;Simulant used to evaluate a process for oxygen production needs to 
			match regolith chemistry more so than geotechnical properties.</p>
			<p>
			The first simulant for general use was JSC-1, and it was intended 
			for engineering studies concerned with material handling, 
			construction, excavation and transportation&nbsp;(McKay, 
			1994).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;JSC-1 
			attempted to approximate the grain (particle) size distribution of 
			lunar soils, using a volcanic ash that was repeatedly impacted to 
			reduce particle size. Figure 13 shows a tumble test of fabric bags 
			filled with JSC-1 and placed in a rotating drum for almost 1000 
			rotations, used to evaluate a fabric’s resistance to regolith 
			abrasion&nbsp;(Smithers, 
			2007).&nbsp;&nbsp;JSC-1 
			is now all used up, but new simulants JSC-1AF (with particles &lt;/= 50mm 
			diameter), JSC-1AVF (with particles &lt;/= 20&nbsp;mm 
			diameter) and JSC-1AC (with particles 1mm to 5 mm diameter) have 
			been created.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 
			simulant can be purchased from ORBITEC while the supply lasts.&nbsp;New 
			simulants are being created to incorporate the iron droplets in the 
			agglutinate, to be used to test microwave and magnetic 
			susceptibility&nbsp;(Schrunk, 
			2008).</p>
